# A really simple InertiaJS + Laravel + SvelteJS Boilerplate application.

## Install/Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` to start developing.

## Things included:

- TailwindCSS + PostCSS for styling.
- Svelte + Vite-Plugin-Svelte
- Some custom stuff for using with Valet + SSL secured sites locally (more on that soon).

## Known issues:

No **known** issues with the currently defined setup here, but Svelte is not currently exhaustively documented when using with Inertia, most of the things we've come to find have been through trial + error.
